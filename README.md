### Notices

**Assignment \#5: Working with Data** in Python has been posted to the assignments folder. Please submit the assignment by **9:30am on Thursday 21st April**.

**Python and Programming Review Workshop** is scheduled for **Monday 18th April** from **6:00pm to 8:00pm**. Location: **Waverly Room 370**. Please bring your laptops. This workshop is for those that are new to programming. We will be reviewing the basics of Python (Types, Conditional Logic, Loops) and basic Linear Algebra operations. 

**Note** To get the best rendering for notebooks it is best to use nbviewer. This can be done by prepending the notebook web address with http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/. An example is:

http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mmcky/nyu-econ-370/blob/master/notebooks/notes-linear-algebra.ipynb

Please submit assignments to: econ370nyu@gmail.com as a Jupyter notebook with your solutions.

### MyBinder Service

The MyBinder service launches a live programming environment in the Cloud and allows you to interact with the course notebooks. However the changes to these notebooks are **temporary** and do not persist next time you open the notebook. For these types of changes it is best to download the notebooks to your computer and run ``jupyter notebook`` in a terminal (or powershell in windows) in the folder that contains your notebook files.
